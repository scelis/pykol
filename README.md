pykol
=====

IMPORTANT
---------
pykol is no longer under active development and has been archived. If you are interested in a more recent project, check out [libkol](https://github.com/python-kol/libkol).

What is it?
-----------
The purpose of pykol is to create a [Python](http://www.python.org/) package that makes it extremely easy to develop code that works with [The Kingdom of Loathing](http://www.kingdomofloathing.com). pykol can be used for anything from writing short scripts to complex bots. In fact, both [kBay](http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com:8080/vb/showthread.php?t=141613) and [wadbot](http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com:8080/vb/showthread.php?t=152258) are built completely on top of it.

Who is it for?
--------------
pykol is for programmers who are interested in writing scripts and bots for KoL. If you do not feel comfortable writing code, then pykol is probably not for you.

Example
-------
The following is some example code that demonstrates how to login to The Kingdom of Loathing, grab the contents of your inbox, access the item database, as well as use and smash items.

```python
from kol.Session import Session
from kol.database import ItemDatabase
from kol.request.GetMessagesRequest import GetMessagesRequest
from kol.request.PulverizeRequest import PulverizeRequest
from kol.request.UseItemRequest import UseItemRequest

# Login to the KoL servers.
s = Session()
s.login("myUserName", "myPassword")

# Get a list of your kmails and print them out.
r = GetMessagesRequest(s)
responseData = r.doRequest()
kmails = responseData["kmails"]
for kmail in kmails:
	print "Received kmail from %s (#%s)" % (kmail["userName"], kmail["userId"])
	print "Text: %s" % kmail["text"]
	print "Meat: %s" % kmail["meat"]
	for item in kmail["items"]:
		print "Item: %s (%s)" % (item["name"], item["quantity"])

# Use an old coin purse.
item = ItemDatabase.getItemFromName("old coin purse")
r = UseItemRequest(s, item["id"])
r.doRequest()

# Smash a titanium assault umbrella and print out the results.
item = ItemDatabase.getItemFromName("titanium assault umbrella")
r = PulverizeRequest(s, item["id"])
responseData = r.doRequest()
smashResults = responseData["results"]
print "After smashing the item you have received the following:"
for result in smashResults:
	print "%s (%s)" % (result["name"], result["quantity"])

# Now we logout.
s.logout()
```

Requirements
------------
pykol requires Python 2.7. It does not require any third-party libraries, however it does use a number of libraries that ship with the standard distribution of Python.

Running the Unit Tests
----------------------
pykol includes a [unittest](http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) suite, to showcase some of its functionality and to help ensure that new game changes don't break your existing code. Developers are strongly encouraged to add unit tests for new features that they create.

To run the test suite:

1. Add the `pykol\src` directory to your Python path. On Windows, this will involve a trip to Environment Variables (see [this Python path on Windows tutorial](http://www.katsbits.com/tutorials/blender/setting-up-windows-python-path-system-variable.php) for an example). On Mac OS X or on Linux, you can add an `export PYTHONPATH` statement to your `~/.bashrc` file. For example, add this to the .bashrc file in your home directory (don't forget to either restart the terminal or ```source ~/.bashrc``` afterwards):

	```
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/yourname/Documents/py-kol/src
	```

2. Run the full test suite from the command line, and pass in a username and password for your character (the tests include logging in, etc).

	```
	$ cd pykol
	$ python src/kol/test/TestAll.py username password
	```

How can I contribute?
---------------------
1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) pykol
2. Clone your fork - `git clone git@github.com:your_username/pykol.git`
3. Add a remote to this repository - `git remote add upstream git://github.com/scelis/pykol.git`
4. Fetch the current pykol sources - `git fetch upstream`
5. Create a topic branch - `git checkout -b my_branch upstream/master`
6. Commit (or cherry-pick) your changes
7. Push your branch to github - `git push origin my_branch`
8. Create an [Issue](http://github.com/scelis/pykol/issues) with a link to your branch
9. That's it!
